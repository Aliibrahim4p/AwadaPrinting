# Awada Printing Services

## Introduction
**Awada Printing Services** is a personal freelance project designed as a **web-based business management system** for small and medium printing businesses.  
The application focuses on handling **core operational workflows**, including inventory, orders, deliveries, clients, and financial tracking.

This project represents my **first real-world application** built with a **PHP REST API backend**, a **React frontend**, and **PostgreSQL** as the database engine.  
The goal is to design a **clean, scalable, and maintainable system** that reflects real business requirements rather than academic examples.

## Authentication & Deployment Scope
This application is currently designed as a **local-host, offline system** intended for internal business use.

- The system is **not production-hardened** and is not exposed to the public internet  

Security enhancements and production deployment considerations are planned for future iterations.
